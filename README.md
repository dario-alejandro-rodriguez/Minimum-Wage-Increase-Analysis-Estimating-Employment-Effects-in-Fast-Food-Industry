# Minimum Wage Increase Analysis: Estimating Employment Effects in the Fast-Food Industry

## Project Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the effect of the minimum wage increase in New Jersey on employment in the fast-food industry. This project used panel data from a 1993 study by David Card and Alan Krueger, which analyzed the minimum wage increase in April 1992. The goal was to familiarize and practice with the Difference-in-differences model, construct confidence intervals based on parameter estimates and SEs, test situational hypotheses, and analyze the fixed effects of different terms on the model.
